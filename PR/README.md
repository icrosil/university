Objects recognition works.

To compile project use next command:

`gcc -o exec_name main_oi.cpp -lstdc++`

To run execute compiled file.
By default it is running last lab.

Works:
1. Files directory consist of POK files with patients data about damaged cells.
   'D2' and 'D3' are different sickness. So first work comparing D2~D2, D2~D3,
   D3~D3, D3~D2 about each column (15) that identifies patient.
2. What if we comparing in mean way?
   D2~D3 equals to D3~D2.
3. How much is influense here in D2 and D3 ?
4. How to build ellipse around set of points?
   Is there any difference to shrink or grow rects?
5. Simple categorizition (dont work)
6. In this work we want to consider other ways to compare vectors.
   Here we testing with standard method Delta and Interval Tree.

For program you need POK directories `./files/D2/D201.POK ... ./files/D3/D341.POK`.
