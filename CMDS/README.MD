# CMDS
Dynamic Systems works.

To start work proceed next steps:
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`

Works:
1. Visualization for pendulum motion. With forced oscillations.
   Based on [Burak Kanber pendulum](http://burakkanber.com/blog/modeling-physics-in-javascript-introduction/)
2. Function of forced oscillations could be wrong. (Still in progress)

TODO:
- get know all processes going on with physics here
- make forces more visible and understandable
